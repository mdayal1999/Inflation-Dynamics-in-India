# Inflation-Dynamics-in-India (2013–2025) : A Data-Driven Analysis Using CPI, WPI & RBI Repo Rate.
## Overview
This project analyzes inflation trends in India from 2013 to 2025, using official datasets sourced from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Database on the Indian Economy (DBIE). It explores the movement of Consumer Price Index (CPI), Wholesale Price Index (WPI), and RBI Repo Rate, along with category-wise consumer inflation patterns. 
## Key Insights
- CPI remained more stable than WPI, which reacted sharply to global commodity shocks.
- Repo Rate changes typically follow inflation trends with a policy lag.
- Food inflation is the largest driver of headline CPI movements.
- Rural inflation shows more volatility due to food & energy dependency.
- Major shocks (COVID-19, Russia–Ukraine Conflict, Demonetization,GST Implementation) created visible inflation spikes.
